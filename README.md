# WiiRazor
A trojan wiper program/bricker for the Nintendo Wii

# What is WiiRazor?
WiiRazor is my method of creating a bricker program for the Wii. Upon startup of the program, it will search for important system files, overwrite them, and disassociate said directories with the operating system (IOS (not to be confused with Apple's IOS))

The source code has been compiled using DevKitPro (the source will never be released!)

I had written this software because malware is what brought me into the cybersecurity field and I felt that with the scare-tactic that was Project Dandelion in 2019, it was about time developers could be warned of potential infections of homebrewed applications. That is why I included a splash screen for this, so it could be identified the moment an infected app was ran and the user could take measures to leave.

This program will only work on homebrewed Wii devices, like any other custom application would.

THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY! I DO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY UNINTENTIONAL HARM
DONE TO ANY CONSOLES! YOU RUN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BRICKING YOUR DEVICE BY INSTALLING WIIRAZOR

That being said, if you purchased this software somehow, you have been scammed, and you should demand your money back before it's too late.

# How to Install
-Download the .Dol file, .xml file and image file. Place it in /apps/WiiRazor on your SD card. If the directory doesn't exist, create it and place the files there. Boot up the console and go to the Homebrew Channel on your Wii and select WiiRazor. Wait 15-20 seconds and the destruction process will begin.
